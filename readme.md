# tuclock

This is a simple tui clock written in Rust.

The code is *heavily* inspired by the [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) book.

## Installation

- Clone the repo
- `cargo run`

## Features

Current:

- Tells the time in `tui-big-text` characters
- looks ugly

Future:

- Accept time format string from command line argument
- Edit time format while running
- Colours
- Other information, maybe
